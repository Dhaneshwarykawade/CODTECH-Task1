### 1. **Objective**
The objective of this project is to create a simple, user-friendly to-do list application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to add tasks, mark them as complete, and delete them. It aims to provide a basic yet effective tool for task management that can be easily extended with additional features.

### 2. **Key Activities**
- **Task Addition**: Users can input new tasks into the application via a text field and add them to the list.
- **Task Completion**: Users can mark tasks as completed, which visually distinguishes them from pending tasks.
- **Task Deletion**: Users can remove tasks from the list when they are no longer needed.
- **User Interface Design**: Implementing a clean, intuitive interface that enhances the user experience.
- **Documentation**: Providing clear and comprehensive documentation to guide users and developers in understanding and extending the application.

### 3. **Technologies Used**
- **HTML5**: Used to structure the content and elements of the to-do list application.
- **CSS3**: Applied to style the application, making it visually appealing and user-friendly.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Provides the interactivity and functionality, such as adding, completing, and deleting tasks.
- **Version Control**: Git for version control and GitHub for code repository hosting and collaboration.
  
### 4. **Working**
The to-do list application works as follows:

- **User Interface**:
  - The user interacts with a simple interface that includes an input field for adding tasks and a button to submit them.
  - Below the input field, tasks are displayed in a list format.
  
- **Task Management**:
  - **Adding Tasks**: When the user enters a task in the input field and clicks the "Add" button, the task is added to the list.
  - **Marking as Complete**: The user can click on a task in the list to toggle its completion status. Completed tasks are visually differentiated using a strikethrough effect.
  - **Deleting Tasks**: Each task has a "Delete" button next to it. When clicked, the task is removed from the list.

- **User Experience**:
  - The application provides immediate feedback for each action, ensuring that users can efficiently manage their tasks.
  - The design is responsive and minimalistic, making it accessible on various devices.


### Conclusion
This application serves as a foundational project for learning and implementing basic front-end development skills. The structure and logic are simple but can be expanded with additional features such as persistent storage (e.g., using localStorage), task categorization, and deadline reminders.
